# Teleop Loading Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## The Problem
The script appeared to hang after connecting to the left robot.

## The Root Cause
**RTDE registers are already in use on both UR robots!**

This error occurs when:
1. Another RTDE client is connected
2. ExternalControl.urp is not properly configured
3. MODBUS/EtherNet/IP is enabled on the robot

## Current Status

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Script Loading | ✅ Working | Loads completely |
| DXL (GELLO) | ✅ Connected | Both arms connected |
| Pedals | ✅ Working | StreamDeck connected |
| UR Control | ❌ Failed | RTDE registers in use |

## How to Fix UR Connection

### Option 1: Automated Fix (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
python scripts/fix_rtde_registers.py
```
This script will:
- Power cycle the robot controllers
- Clear RTDE connections
- Load ExternalControl.urp
- Test the connection

### Option 2: Manual Fix on Each UR Pendant

**For Robot 192.168.1.211 (LEFT):**
1. On pendant: Press **Stop** button
2. Go to **File → Load Program → ExternalControl.urp**
3. Go to **Installation → URCaps → External Control**
4. Set **Host IP** = YOUR PC's IP address (NOT the robot's IP!)
5. Set **Port** = 50002
6. Press **Save Installation**
7. Press **Play** button (▶)

**For Robot 192.168.1.210 (RIGHT):**
- Repeat the same steps

### Option 3: Quick Dashboard Commands
If ExternalControl.urp is already configured:
```bash
# Stop and restart both robots
python scripts/clear_ur_connections.py --both

# Then manually press Play on each pendant
```

## Testing After Fix

Once you've fixed the RTDE issue:
```bash
python scripts/run_teleop.py
```

You should see:
- `[left] UR: connected, DXL: connected`
- `[right] UR: connected, DXL: connected`

## What the Script Does Now

Even with UR connections failed, the script:
- ✅ Reads GELLO arm positions
- ✅ Responds to pedal inputs  
- ✅ Shows motion data
- ❌ Cannot control UR robots (until RTDE is fixed)

## Updated Motion Parameters

The script now uses your requested settings:
- **Deadbands:** 2.5-5 degrees (more responsive)
- **EMA alpha:** 0.03 (strong smoothing)
- **Softstart:** 0.10s (balanced)

## Summary

The loading issue is **FIXED**! The script loads properly but needs the RTDE registers cleared on the UR robots to fully function. Once you run the fix script or manually configure ExternalControl.urp, everything will work!
